# Patapon 2 Binary Loader

### What's in there?

In this repository, you'll find the files I made in [wololo.net](wololo.net)'s Learning Journey articles.

This particular repository is about [part 4](http://wololo.net/?p=41189&preview=true)'s achievements on Patapon 2, namely writing a binary loader.

The files here will be updated as the series go, so you can always check the commits to see how they've evolved with time.

### Can I help you with anything?

Yeah, of course, you can always go ask and tell me anything at [@theoct0](twitter.com/theoct0) on Twitter, any help regarding something I was wrong about, or something I could have done better, will be greatly appreciated.
